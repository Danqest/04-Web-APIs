# 04-Web-APIs

This project is an exercise in building a quiz game from scratch using html, css, and javascript.

The project involves the creation of a webpage in html, beautifying it in css, and giving it overall functionality in javascript. The expectation is to have various quiz questions drawn and a series of possible answers presented. Right and wrong answers involve positive or negative rewards via score or time modification. Once the game is over, the user is prompted to enter their Player Name which will be saved and displayed along with their score when the View Score button is interacted with.
